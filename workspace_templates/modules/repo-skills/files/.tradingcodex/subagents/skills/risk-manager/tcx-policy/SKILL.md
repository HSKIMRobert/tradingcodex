# Policy Review

Use this skill to evaluate restricted list, approval readiness, policy constraints, universe/instrument support, adapter eligibility, and information barriers.

Universe and policy posture:

- Identify the asset universe, instrument, order path, broker/adapter, and whether that path is installed and enabled.
- Treat unsupported universes or instruments as `revise`, `deny`, or `blocked`; do not infer permission from research-only support.
- Confirm that external data tools, imported skills, or connector availability do not widen execution permissions.
- Live execution remains disabled unless a user-installed adapter and policy explicitly enable it.

Expected output:

- Policy decision: allow, revise, or deny
- Reasons
- Required approvals
- Restricted list result
- Universe/instrument support result
- Adapter eligibility result
- Barrier concerns
- Audit notes

Quality floor:

- Apply the shared artifact quality floor for narrative policy memos.
- Distinguish sourced facts, analysis, and assumptions in natural prose where it matters.
- Name the exact policy, restricted-list, approval, or adapter gate that matters.
- Distinguish a policy deny from an incomplete-evidence revise state.
- State safe next action, blocked actions, and whether the request is research-only, paper eligible, reviewed-provider eligible, or unsupported.
- Do not fabricate policy state, restricted-list entries, approval receipts, or adapter availability.
- State the safe next action and blocked actions.
